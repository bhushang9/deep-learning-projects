# 😷 Face Mask Detection – Deep Learning Project

This project predicts whether a person is *wearing a mask* or *not wearing a mask* using a deep learning model trained on real face mask images. The entire system is built and tested in Google Colab.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on thousands of labeled images and can then accurately detect mask usage in any new random uploaded image.

---

## 📁 Dataset
- Face Mask Dataset from Kaggle  
- Contains two folders:
  - with_mask
  - without_mask
- Includes over 7,500+ images combined.

---

## 🧠 What the Model Does
- Learns features from mask and non-mask images  
- Evaluates accuracy on test data  
- Allows you to upload any random image for prediction  
- Displays the image correctly (RGB/BGR fix applied)  
- Outputs whether the person is wearing a mask  

---

## 📊 Results
- The model performs well on both training and test data.
- Successfully predicts mask usage on random real-world uploaded images.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Add stronger pre-trained models (MobileNetV2, ResNet)  
- Deploy as a web app (Flask, Streamlit)  
- Enable real-time webcam mask detection  
- Detect incorrectly worn masks
